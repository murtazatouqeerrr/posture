"Act as a senior front-end developer and UI/UX designer. Our Posture Perfect CRM SPA is fully functional but looks outdated. We need a complete visual overhaul to create a modern, clean, and professional healthcare application. We will use the Tailwind CSS framework for rapid, beautiful styling.

1. Integration of Tailwind CSS:

First, add the Tailwind CSS CDN script tag to the <head> of our single index.html SPA file. Use the latest version.

Instruct me to use the standalone Tailwind CLI to generate a full stylesheet if we need more control later, but for now, the CDN is sufficient for development.

2. Modern Layout & Structure:
Refactor the entire index.html structure to use a modern layout:

A sleek sidebar navigation on the left for main links (Dashboard, Patients, Calendar, Admin) instead of a top bar. The sidebar should collapse to icons on smaller screens.

A top header bar that shows the current user's name, role, and a logout button.

A main content area with plenty of white space, subtle shadows, and rounded corners on cards. This is where our #app container will be.

Use a clean, professional color scheme. Suggest a primary color like a calming blue (#3B82F6) or teal (#0F766E) for accents, with a mostly white and light gray background.

3. Component Styling with Tailwind:
We need to completely restyle every single component using Tailwind's utility classes. Generate the code for:

Login/Signup Forms: These should be centered beautifully on the page with a card-like design (bg-white, shadow, rounded-lg, p-8), stylish input fields, and a prominent button.

Data Tables: Style the main patient/contact table with alternating row colors (hover:bg-gray-50), clear headers, and styled action buttons (view, edit) using icons from Heroicons or similar.

Cards for Analytics: On the dashboard and admin panel, display key metrics (Total Patients, Revenue, etc.) in individual cards with a number, a label, and an icon. Use grid for a responsive layout.

Forms: All forms (adding a patient, logging a session) should be well-spaced, with elegant labels and inputs. Use border, rounded, and focus:ring classes for inputs.

Buttons: Create a consistent style for primary buttons (bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white), secondary buttons, and danger buttons (red for delete actions).

Tabs: Style the Admin Dashboard tabs as a modern tabbed interface with a bottom border indicator for the active tab.

4. Dashboard & Admin Panel UI:

Main Dashboard: Create a layout that shows the data table and maybe a small summary card of today's appointments.

Admin Dashboard: Make this visually impressive. The user management table should be sleek. The analytics should use Chart.js but be contained in well-styled cards with headers. Ensure the charts are responsive.

5. Interactions & Feedback:

Add subtle animations for transitions (e.g., transition and hover: classes on buttons).

Implement modern modals for actions like "Edit Patient" or "Confirm Delete" instead of navigating to a new page. Use a hidden div that becomes visible with flex and fixed positioning.

Add loading spinners (using Tailwind's animation classes) whenever data is being fetched from the API.

6. Responsive Design:
Ensure everything looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (e.g., md:flex, text-sm md:text-base) to adjust the layout, especially the sidebar navigation.

Please provide the complete refactored code:

The fully styled index.html with the new layout (sidebar, header, main content area).

The complete JavaScript (app.js) updated to work with the new HTML structure and to render all dynamically loaded content with the correct Tailwind CSS classes.

Instructions on how to integrate Chart.js for the admin analytics charts within this new styled environment.

The final result should be a CRM that looks like a modern SaaS product (comparable to systems like Calendly or Circle.so), not a 1990s database interface. Focus on clarity, spacing, typography, and a professional color scheme."
