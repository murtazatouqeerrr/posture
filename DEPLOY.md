# Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your Posture Perfect CRM is now configured for Vercel deployment.

### ✅ What's Configured:

1. **vercel.json** - Deployment configuration
2. **api/index.js** - Serverless entry point  
3. **server-final-working.js** - Main application with Vercel compatibility
4. **.vercelignore** - Excludes unnecessary files
5. **package.json** - Updated scripts and entry point

### 🔧 Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Production Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### 📊 Features Available:

- ✅ All CRM functionality
- ✅ Mock data (SQLite replaced for serverless)
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ✅ Dashboard, contacts, packages, pre-visit
- ✅ Reports and analytics
- ✅ Responsive design

### 🔄 Local Development:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

### 🌐 After Deployment:

Your CRM will be available at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

All features will work with mock data since Vercel doesn't support SQLite in serverless functions.

### 📝 Note:

For production with real database, consider:
- Vercel Postgres
- PlanetScale
- Supabase
- MongoDB Atlas
